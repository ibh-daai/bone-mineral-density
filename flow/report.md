# FIRST-TIME ADULT BMD REPORT
## Demographics
* name
* date of birth
* sex
* provincial healthcare number or other identifier
* height measured at facility
* weight measured at facility
* scan date
* report date
* referring physician
* reporting physician
* facility name and location
## Diagnostic Category
* Age
    * \>= 50 years
        * The lowest T-score for the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, 1/3 (or 33%) radius, and total body. T-scores are derived using a **white female reference database for women** and a **white male reference database for men**.
            * T-score >= -1 : "Normal"
            * -2.5 < T-score < -1 : "Low Bone Mass"
            * T-score <= -2.5 : "Osteoporosis"
    * < 50 years
        * The lowest Z-score for the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, 1/3 (or 33%) radius, and total body. Z-scores are derived using a **white female reference database for women** and a **white male reference database for men**.
            * Z-score > -2.0 : "Within expected range for age"
            * Z-score <= -2.0 : "Below expected range for age"
## Fracture Risk Category
* Age
    * \>= 50 years
        * "High" If (OR)
            * Fragility fracture history after age 40 years AND glucocorticoid history
            * Fragility hip fracture after age 40 years
            * Fragility vertebral fracture after age 40 years
            * \>=2 fragility fracture after age 40 years.
        * Using Femoral neck T-score (derived from white female reference database)
            * Identify closest age group from CAROC 2010 risk table 
            * Identify corresponding risk group (Low vs Moderate vs High)
            * If fragility fracture history OR glucocorticoid history are positive 
                * Move risk one up
            * If "Low"
                * Using lumbar spine T-score (using a white male reference database for men and a white female reference database for women)
                * If the lumbar spine T-score is <= -2.5 return "Moderate"
    * < 50 years
        * NA. Skip section
        * Absolute risk assessment is not available and a fracture risk category should not be reported
* If patient on bone active drug therapy
    * Indicate risk may be lower than calculated if osteo drug therapy is effective
* If glucocorticoid OR ragility fracture status
    * state history
## BMD Data
* Minimum of 2 sitess  should be scanned and reported
* Default
    * Lumbar spine
        * L1 to L4
        * Unless decission to exclude due to technical artifacts
        * A minimum of two vertebrae should be used
        * Exclude if T-score of one is > 1 SD of the verterbra with next highest value (not mandatory) but decission to be made re artificat or not
    * Proximal femur
        * Measure left side
        * If not
            * Not available
            * Invalid
            * Right was measured before (subsequent study)
    * If above two not available
        * Use non dominant forearm
            * 1/3 radius 
        * Dominant forearm
    * If no wrist (no forearm)
        * Total body BMD
            * Head included or excluded. Needs to be noted
    * Bilateral hip
        * Reported seperately
        * Lowest T score
    * If weight exceeds DXA, bilateral forearm

## Limitations
## Interpretation
## Recommended Follow-Up Date
* Based on expected rate of BMD change
* Use Appendix 6 table
## Definitions
## Machine Identification
* brand
* model
* serial number
