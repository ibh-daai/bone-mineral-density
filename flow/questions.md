* Fragility fractures
    * Definitions?
    * Fractures of the forearm, vertebra, proximal femur, and proximal humerus are usually fragility fractures if they occurred subsequent to a fall from a standing or sitting height. Generally, craniofacial fractures and fractures of the hands and feet are not considered fragility fractures. Other types of fractures may be regarded as fragility fractures if the history suggests that the fracture occurred with a degree of trauma that would not normally be expected to lead to a broken bone.
    * Glucocorticoid history is considered positive if prednisone (or other glucocorticoids in terms of prednisone equivalents) was in use at a dose equal to or greater than 7.5 mg per day for more than three cumulative months in the prior 12 months. Patients with hypoadrenalism on replacement glucocorticoids should not be considered to have a positive glucocorticoid history for fracture risk determination regardless of glucocorticoid dose.
* Exclude when
    * Femoral neck and spine are not available 
    * Femoral neck not available, spine available but a T-score > -2.5
        * **Implies if femoral unavailable, but spine < -2.5 then moderate???**
    * If femoral neck is much lower than -2.5 or T-scores of other skeletal sites are much lower than the value of the femoral neck
